    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious pasta casserole that my boss's wife cooked and sent with him for us all to share. It is really creamy and delicious! It does not taste at all like pumpkin!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound rotini pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain sausage on paper towels and reserve 2 tablespoons grease in the skillet. Add oil to grease in the skillet; cook and stir onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil-grease until onion is soft, about 3 minutes.        </li>
    </ol>
