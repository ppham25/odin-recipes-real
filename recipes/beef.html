    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simply the best baked ziti recipe. I am half Italian, was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, and have filmed almost 2,000 recipe videos, so when you consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I have never posted a video for baked ziti. Hopefully I make up for that long wait by posting what I think is the best version of it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.</li>
    </ol>
